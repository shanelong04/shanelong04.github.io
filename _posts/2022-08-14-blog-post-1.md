When solving a general AI problem or a particular Object Detection problem, the understanding and capture of data is an important condition for an effective approach to problem and model building strategy. 

## Survey the information of image dataset
======
One of the basic and prioritized information to capture is the size of the image.
We need to know if all the images in the dataset have the same size or not


## Statistics on the number of bounding boxes (objects detected) in the image
======
The information to find out in the dataset is the number of bounding boxes in an image (appearance density).
This is useful information for us to know if the problem's data is a "crowded" form
