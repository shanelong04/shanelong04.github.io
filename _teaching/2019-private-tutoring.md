I am a freelance tutor with **800+ hours** of experience since 2019, and a final year PhD Student at University College London (UCL) working in Space Physics and Machine Learning.

I teach privately for students from primary and secondary school in a range of subjects:
* Maths (GCSE, A-level)
* Additional Maths (GCSE)
* Further Maths (A-level)
* Physics (GCSE, A-level)
* Chemistry (GCSE, A-level)
* Computer Science (GCSE)
* Python programming
* Piano (ABRSM Grade 1 - 8)
* Music Theory (ABRSM Grade 1 - 6)

Here is a quick video about my teaching style:

Part of my role at UCL is being a Teaching Assistant for the Research Software Engineering With Python course and a coursework marker for Electromagnetic Theory courses. During my Physics Masters' degree at Imperial College London, I volunteered in a Peer-Assisted-Learning program to help younger Undergraduate students on specific problems from their courses and provided general advice such as revision tips. 

My other interests include health and fitness, investing, music, making videos for YouTube, and being environmentally conscious. 

If you are interested in learning more about science, maths, computers/programming, or you just want some guidance with your school work, feel free to drop me a message at i.cheng.19@ucl.ac.uk.
