I was a teaching assistant on this course to help student construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment. Giving practical techniques, tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex Python code.

I marked coding assignments on the submitty platform, reviewing git commit sizes, appropriate commit messages, and checking for artefacts in commits.
