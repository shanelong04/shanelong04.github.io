I am a data-intensive science PhD Student at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/i-kit-matthew-cheng-phd-student) specializing in space plasma physics with a keen interest in using **machine learning** to complement **scientific endeavours**. My research is focused on applying explainable deep learning techniques to spacecraft time-series data to detect bow shock and magnetopause boundary crossings at **Saturn** and to analyse the plasma processes which occur in the vicinity of these boundary layers such as different **plasma instabilities**.

Part of my role at university is being a **Teaching Assistant** for the **Research Software Engineering With Python** course and a coursework marker for **Electromagnetic Theory** courses. Outside of univeristy, I am also a **private tutor** teaching primary and secondary school students a wide range of subjects from Maths and Physics to Python programming and piano. My other passions include health and fitness, investing, music, making videos for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/chinamatt), and being environmentally conscious.
